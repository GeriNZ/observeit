      <h1>Welcome to ObserveIt</h1>
      <p>
        This is a companion app to the chapter by Bengsch, G. (2021).
        Observations. In Abigail Parrish & Ghazal Syed. A Quick Guide to
        Research Methods for Dissertations in Education. Bloomsberry.
      </p>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Practice observing and taking notes</li>
        <li>
          Download your notes in csv format to use in other software, such as
          Excel or NVivo
        </li>
        <li>Take additional notes that downloads into .txt format</li>
        <li>
          Capture screenshots with timestamps (to save displayed screenshot,
          please right-click and select save image as)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to use</h2>
      <p>
        Watch the video and fill in the form according to the notes in the
        chapter. You can also use the form to make notes on your own material
        and download it into a csv file to further work with in another piece of
        software. Keep in mind that "csv" stands for "comma separated value". That means, that you order your observations in the form through the use of commas: whenvever you use a comma, the following content will be stored in the next field in an application like Excel or NVivo, which will make it easier for you to deal with the large amount of observational data you are likely to create!
        <p>Much like in real life, you can only store one mental picture (here: screenshot). Make sure that you right-click on them to save them to your computer for later before moving on to take the next picture - unlike in real life, you always have the option to pause the video, or to rewind!
          </p>

      </p>
      <i>Please note: No data is stored on this website. Please make sure to download your notes and save your screenshot before refreshing the page!</i>
      <p>The page will remind you to check whether you are ready to refresh the page or not. If a check box appears that wants to create additional dialogues, please tick it to prevent this behaviour: </p>
      <img src="images/reload.png" style= "transform:scale(0.8);"  onclick="showMarkerArea(this);"/>
     

    </div>

    <h2>Doing observations</h2>
    <!-- <p>Choose whether you want to use a random video to practice on, or upload your own (remember, your video will not be stored on the site - as soon as you reload the page or close it, the video will no longer be available unless you upload it again).</p> -->
    <p>While you are watching the video, you are likely to notice that it is very difficult to keep track of what you are observing, but it will get better the more you practice! Remember, your notes only need to make sense to yourself. Consider inventing your own shorthand when taking notes. When you are done with the video, read through your notes and expand on them before downloading them. You can also take this time to organise them better. Remember, commas will move observations to the next field under the same heading. Make use of this to organise your observations!</p>
